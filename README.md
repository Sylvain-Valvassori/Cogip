# About Cogip

COGIP is a company that produces Jean-Michel toys.
The accounting employees of COGIP use an old and incomplete software with a poor design.



# The mission


Update the database.
Create different administrator space. 
Create a new design for the application.
Rethink the application architecture using the MVC system.

# How it was developed

The application is developed in PHP POO with a look and feel made with CSS/SCSS. 

## First we have the main parts
The application is divided into five main parts:
- Home page
- Contacts page
- Companies page
- Invoices page
- Login page


 **Home page** <br/>
There are three tables containing the last five additions to each.

**Contacts page**<br/>
It contains a table with all the company's contacts.

 **Societies page**<br/>
It contains all the companies classified in two tables: customers and suppliers who work with Cogip.

**Invoice page**<br/>
Contains a table with all the company's invoices.

**Login page**<br/>
Allows you to log in.

## Then there are the secondary parts

**The first one:**<br/> 
This is the detail part for companies, invoices and contacts.
When you select an item, it displays a new page with all the data concerning the selected item. 

**The second:**<br/> 
This is when the administrator logs in, special options appear. He has the possibility to add, modify and delete data.
